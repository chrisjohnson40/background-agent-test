# Feature: Custom Landing Page

## Overview
Replace the default Angular welcome page with a custom garage inventory management landing page that provides users with an introduction to the application and clear navigation options.

## User Story
As a user visiting the garage inventory application for the first time, I want to see a welcoming and informative landing page that explains what the application does and provides clear paths to get started, so that I understand the value proposition and can easily begin using the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ‚úÖ Visual Design & Layout
- [ ] Remove all default Angular welcome content from `app.html`
- [ ] Create a modern, responsive landing page layout
- [ ] Include a hero section with application branding
- [ ] Display clear value proposition and key features
- [ ] Use Angular Material components for consistent styling
- [ ] Implement responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Add appropriate spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

### ‚úÖ Content Requirements
- [ ] Application title: "Garage Inventory Management"
- [ ] Tagline/description explaining the app's purpose
- [ ] List of key features (e.g., "Track items", "Organize locations", "Search inventory")
- [ ] Call-to-action buttons for "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
- [ ] Optional: Brief explanation of how the system works

### ‚úÖ Navigation & Routing
- [ ] Add "Login" button that will route to `/login` (route setup for future)
- [ ] Add "Register" button that will route to `/register` (route setup for future)
- [ ] Buttons should be styled but functional routing will be implemented later
- [ ] Include placeholder navigation in header component

### ‚úÖ Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `LandingPageComponent` as a standalone component
- [ ] Update `app.routes.ts` to include landing page route (`/` and `/home`)
- [ ] Update `app.html` to remove default content and use clean router-outlet
- [ ] Import required Angular Material modules
- [ ] Follow Angular style guide and project conventions
- [ ] Use TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Implement OnPush change detection where appropriate

### ‚úÖ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- [ ] **MUST WRITE TESTS FIRST** - Create `landing-page.component.spec.ts` before implementation
- [ ] Test component creation and basic rendering
- [ ] Test that all required content elements are displayed
- [ ] Test button presence and accessibility
- [ ] Test responsive behavior (if applicable)
- [ ] Test routing button functionality (when routes are added)
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- [ ] All tests must pass before implementation is considered complete

### ‚úÖ Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- [ ] Use appropriate heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
- [ ] Include alt text for any images
- [ ] Test with screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
frontend/src/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing-page.component.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing-page.component.html
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing-page.component.scss
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ landing-page.component.spec.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.routes.ts (update)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.html (clean up)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.scss (update if needed)
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// landing-page.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-landing-page',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, MatButtonModule, MatCardModule, /* others */],
  templateUrl: './landing-page.component.html',
  styleUrl: './landing-page.component.scss',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class LandingPageComponent {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Required Angular Material Modules
- `MatButtonModule` - for CTA buttons
- `MatCardModule` - for feature cards
- `MatIconModule` - for icons
- `MatToolbarModule` - for header/navigation
- Additional modules as needed for design

### Content Suggestions
**Hero Section:**
- Title: "Garage Inventory Management"
- Subtitle: "Organize, track, and manage your garage inventory with ease"

**Key Features:**
- üì¶ Track all your items and their locations
- üè† Organize by rooms, shelves, and containers
- üîç Quick search and filtering
- üì± Mobile-friendly access anywhere

**Call-to-Action:**
- Primary: "Get Started" button
- Secondary: "Learn More" or "Sign In" button

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] All tests written first and passing (TDD approach)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Component follows Angular style guide
- [ ] Default Angular content completely removed
- [ ] Landing page displays correctly on all screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

## Dependencies
- Angular Material (already in project)
- No backend dependencies required
- No external API calls needed

## Estimated Effort
**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
- 1-2 hours: Test writing and TDD setup
- 2-3 hours: Component implementation and styling
- 1 hour: Testing, refinement, and cleanup

## Notes for Implementation
1. **Start with TDD** - Write failing tests first, then implement
2. **Mobile-first design** - Design for mobile, then enhance for desktop
3. **Keep it simple** - Focus on clean, professional appearance
4. **Prepare for future features** - Structure components to easily add authentication later
5. **Use semantic HTML** - Proper heading structure and ARIA labels
6. **Performance** - Optimize images and use OnPush change detection

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- User testimonials section
- Feature demonstration videos
- Integration with actual authentication
- Dynamic content from CMS
- Advanced animations and transitions
- Multi-language support
